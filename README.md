# Shortest-Path-Visualiser-
Graph traversal pathfinding algorithms visualised in Python . Algorithms include , Depth First Search (DFS) & Dijkstra's Algorithm . Think of a graph as a network of nodes. Types of graphs include logistic or road networks, IP routing and GPS coodinates.

# Depth-first search (DFS)
Depth-first search (DFS) starts at the root node and explores the current branches extremeties before backtracking.

# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
